The following estimates are taken into consideration with an active, on-call staff (everyone is awake and on-site/ready).

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

The time it takes to start up a new RDS instance in a new AZ can take less than ten minutes.

Minutes:
1: Problem occurs
2-7: An alert is triggered
8-10: Automatically switch to second availability zone


Minimum RTO for a single region outage

The time it takes to switch to the read replica in another region can take 5 minutes.
Solving the issue for the primary region can take an hour

Minutes:
1: Problem occurs
2-7: An alert is triggered
8-10: Automatically switch to second availability zone
11-30: Discovery for issue in primary region
31-50: Diagnose problem and execute solution for patch
50-60: Issue resolved and primary region stable


Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

RDS has point in time restore available which minimizes data loss as the system fails over from one instance to another.
RPO should be zero.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage

Read replicas are asynchronous aim and kept up to date with the primary DB.
RPO should be zero, critical edge cases can be ten minutes give or take.
