# Recoverability in AWS

This is the first project in the Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

This project uses AWS CloudFormation to create Virtual Private Clouds in order to define the infrastructure in code.

CloudFormation allows you to use a configuration file written in a YAML file to automate the creation of AWS resources such as VPCs. The CloudFormation pre-defined template used in this project originates from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd063-c2-design-for-availability-resilience-reliability-replacement-project-starter-template/blob/master/cloudformation/vpc.yaml). This creates some of the infrastructure to get started on the project.

## Project Files

- `s3`: This directory contains files for the static website.
